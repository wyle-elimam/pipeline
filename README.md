DevOps CI/CD Pipeline
Overview

This repository contains the configuration and scripts for setting up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using popular DevOps tools. The pipeline integrates SonarQube for code quality analysis, Maven for build automation, Jenkins for continuous integration, Nexus for artifact repository management, Docker for containerization, ArgoCD for continuous delivery, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

    Docker
    Kubernetes
    Jenkins
    Maven
    SonarQube
    Nexus

Pipeline Components
1. Jenkins Configuration

Jenkins is used as the main automation server to manage and orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline. The Jenkinsfile in the repository defines the stages of the pipeline, including code checkout, build, test, and deployment.
2. Maven Build

Maven is utilized for building and packaging the application. The pom.xml file contains project configuration, dependencies, and build settings.
3. SonarQube Integration

SonarQube is integrated into the pipeline to perform static code analysis and generate reports on code quality. Ensure you configure SonarQube server details in the Jenkins configuration.
4. Nexus Artifact Repository

Nexus is used as an artifact repository to store and manage build artifacts. The Jenkins pipeline is configured to publish artifacts to Nexus.
5. Docker Image Creation

Docker is employed for containerization. The Dockerfile in the repository specifies the steps to create a Docker image for the application.
6. Kubernetes Deployment with ArgoCD

ArgoCD is used for continuous delivery and Kubernetes manifests are included for deploying the application. The argocd directory contains ArgoCD application configurations.
Getting Started

    Clone this repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

    Configure Jenkins:
        Set up Jenkins with the necessary plugins (e.g., Pipeline, Git, Kubernetes).
        Create Jenkins credentials for Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, and Nexus.

    Update Jenkinsfile:
        Modify the Jenkinsfile to reflect your Jenkins configuration, including credentials and pipeline stages.

    Configure SonarQube:
        Set up a SonarQube server and update Jenkins configuration with the SonarQube server details.

    Configure Nexus:
        Set up a Nexus repository manager and update Jenkins configuration with the Nexus server details.

    Configure ArgoCD:
        Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster and update the ArgoCD application configuration files in the argocd directory.

    Run the Pipeline:
        Trigger the Jenkins pipeline, and monitor the progress in the Jenkins UI.
