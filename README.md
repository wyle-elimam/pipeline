# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration and scripts for setting up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using popular DevOps tools. The pipeline integrates [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) for code quality analysis, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for build automation, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for continuous integration, [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus) for artifact repository management, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization, [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) for continuous delivery, and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container orchestration.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/)
- [Nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation/installation-methods)

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Jenkins Configuration

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is used as the main automation server to manage and orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline. The Jenkinsfile in the repository defines the stages of the pipeline, including code checkout, build, test, and deployment.

### 2. Maven Build

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is utilized for building and packaging the application. The `pom.xml` file contains project configuration, dependencies, and build settings.

### 3. SonarQube Integration

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is integrated into the pipeline to perform static code analysis and generate reports on code quality. Ensure you configure SonarQube server details in the Jenkins configuration.

### 4. Nexus Artifact Repository

[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus) is used as an artifact repository to store and manage build artifacts. The Jenkins pipeline is configured to publish artifacts to Nexus.

### 5. Docker Image Creation

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is employed for containerization. The Dockerfile in the repository specifies the steps to create a Docker image for the application.

### 6. Kubernetes Deployment with ArgoCD

[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is used for continuous delivery, and Kubernetes manifests are included for deploying the application. The `argocd` directory contains ArgoCD application configurations.
